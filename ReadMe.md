# CS-3324 Feb04 Optional Recitation Notes

The code presented in recitation.c is correct and will compile without error
on the version of gcc that ships on Anubis. You can compile and run it from the
Anubis C/C++ playground with the following:

```
gcc recitation.c
```
And then run with:
```
./a.out
```

You will have to upload `mytext` as well to use the file read example.

Many of the `printf`s that demonstrate interesting properties are commented
out so as not to flood the console each time you run the program. You can
uncomment these blocks and recompile the program to see the demonstration if
you so desire.
